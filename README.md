🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: Weather App! 🌤️

I'm thrilled to showcase my latest project—a Weather App built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integrated with the OpenWeather API. 🌍 This app allows users to search for real-time weather information for any city, providing data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more!

💡 Key Features:

Modern UI/UX: Implemented a clean, light theme with clear visibility for fonts and icons, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

Dynamic Weather Display: Shows temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sunrise/sunset times.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), JavaScript
API: OpenWeather API for real-time weather data
Icons: FontAwesome for weather-related icons

🎨 UI/UX Enhancements:

Emphasis on readability and aesthetic appeal with a modern design.
Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

🌟 What’s Next?

I'm continuously working on enhancing the app's features and performance. Future updates will include advanced weather forecasting and additional customization options for users.
